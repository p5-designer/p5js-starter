**Digital Media**

Media Innovation is the process of creating new media: content and ways of sharing that did not exist before. The thermometer was once a new medium: It was invented to observe a phenomenon and communicate that observation beyond the phenomenon itself. The thermostat took the concept one step further by creating a feedback loop between observation and action. AI and Robotics deepen such feedback loops. As human needs and the environments we live in change, we at times need to innovate new media to help us understand and adapt to these changes. 
From 1969 onward, media innovations were concentrated in the area of Information Technology. and many media innovations looked like art projects before they became part of mainstream culture. In courses including Data Arts, Game Design Methods, and Video Art, UC Berkeley students study the history of these innovations, methods for pursuing and realizing ideas collaboratively, and methods for critically understanding the impacts of new media on humans, communities, systems, environments, cats, and other living things. Towards a Data Culture!
An outstanding example of new media art is the work of Alumnus Ian Cheng, who created a new way of making art with his autonomous interactive agents, and of many others who contributed to the development of new games, new cultures, and ultimately, new ways of life.

**ART 23AC: Digital Media: Foundations**

Fall 2022, Summer 2022 Second 6 Week Session
Data and logic form core interfaces for information technology. New media art requires understanding their key dynamics. Students gain experience with data generation, visualization, and their impact on real persons, environments, and situations. Can we measure, count, and weigh everything? Is data fair? What is the role of privacy? How do digital conditions affect human conditions? 
From memes to machine learning, students participate in emerging data cultures including sampling, visualization, animation, video, interactive design, and music. Assignments follow readings on media and design theory, abstraction, interactivity, archives, performance, identity, privacy, automation, aggregation, networking, diffusion, diffraction, and subversion. 

**ART W23AC: Data Arts**

Can we measure everything? What is the role of privacy? Can we count beauty? Is data always fair? 
This course explores participation as the foundation of online citizenship. Participation is based on data literacy and community awareness. Through online assignments, peer reviews, and video chats, students from communities of explorers and innovators challenge data culture through creative interventions including surveys, visualization, animation, video, interaction design, music, and other forms of digital expression. Assignments are based on readings about media theory, abstraction, interactivity, design theory, archives, performance, identity, privacy, automation, aggregation, networking, diffusion, diffraction, and subversion.

**[ART 172 – Advanced Digital Media: Computer Graphics Studio](https://art.berkeley.edu/upper-div-courses)**

Computer Graphics constitute a default method of image synthesis, from fine art to game design, cinema, and advertising. This production-intensive studio course introduces students to professional CG tools (**Blender, Python**) as well as an overview of CG aesthetics. Weekly project assignments based on tutorials cover modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, rendering, physics simulations and data-driven image synthesis. Final projects focus on portfolio work with scenes and characters to be exported into VR, AR, and game design. Instructor: Greg Niemeyer

**ART 173 – Electro-Crafting**

This studio class aims to provide students with the digital tools for expanding and augmenting their work in traditional media such as photography and sculpture, and also to encourage the exploration of new hybrid forms of art-making. If you are interested in exploring sound, sensors, immersive experience, interactivity, bots, wearable computing, gamification, AI, feedback systems, process-oriented artwork, or data-driven artworks in any media--then this may be the class for you. Students will learn to use basic software and hardware for the manipulation of sound, image,s, and videos that were designed by artists for artists, like: **p5.js, sonic pi, makey-make, arduino, and others**.
Only offered in Fall semesters

**ART 174 – Advanced Digital Video**
This advanced studio course is designed for students who have mastered basic skills and concepts involved in digital video production, and are interested in further investigating critical, theoretical, and creative research topics in digital video production. Each week will include relevant readings, class discussions, guest speakers, demonstrat ion of examples, and studio time for training and working on student assignments .

**ART 178 – Game Design Methods**
This course offers an introduction to game design and game studies. Game studies have five core elements: the study of games as transmitters of culture, the study of play and interactivity, the study of games as symbolic systems; the study of games as artifacts; and methods for creating games. We will study these core elements through play, play tests, play analysis, and comparative studies. Our reading list includes classic game studies theory and texts which support game design methods. After weekly writing and design exercises, our coursework will culminate in the design and evaluation of an original code-based game with a tangible interface. Instructor: Greg Niemeyer
