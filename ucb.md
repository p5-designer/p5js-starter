**ART 23AC/W23AC: Digital Media: Foundations(2022 fall)**

Fall 2022, Summer 2022 Second 6 Week Session
Data and logic form core interfaces for information technology. New media art requires understanding their key dynamics. Students gain experience with data generation, visualization, and their impact on real persons, environments, and situations. Can we measure, count, and weigh everything? Is data fair? What is the role of privacy? How do digital conditions affect human conditions? 
From memes to machine learning, students participate in emerging data cultures including sampling, visualization, animation, video, interactive design, and music. Assignments follow readings on media and design theory, abstraction, interactivity, archives, performance, identity, privacy, automation, aggregation, networking, diffusion, diffraction, and subversion. 

**ART W23AC**

Can we measure everything? What is the role of privacy? Can we count beauty? Is data always fair? 
This course explores participation as the foundation of online citizenship. Participation is based on data literacy and community awareness. Through online assignments, peer reviews, and video chats, students from communities of explorers and innovators challenge data culture through creative interventions including surveys, visualization, animation, video, interaction design, music, and other forms of digital expression. Assignments are based on readings about media theory, abstraction, interactivity, design theory, archives, performance, identity, privacy, automation, aggregation, networking, diffusion, diffraction, and subversion.

**[ART 172 – Advanced Digital Media: Computer Graphics Studio (2023 spring)](https://art.berkeley.edu/upper-div-courses)**

Computer Graphics constitute a default method of image synthesis, from fine art to game design, cinema, and advertising. This production-intensive studio course introduces students to professional CG tools (Blender, Python) as well as an overview of CG aesthetics. Weekly project assignments based on tutorials cover modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, rendering, physics simulations and data-driven image synthesis. Final projects focus on portfolio work with scenes and characters to be exported into VR, AR, and game design. Instructor: Greg Niemeyer (Spring 2022)

**ART 173 – Electro-Crafting (2023 fall)**

This studio class aims to provide students with the digital tools for expanding and augmenting their work in traditional media such as photography and sculpture, and also to encourage the exploration of new hybrid forms of art-making. If you are interested in exploring sound, sensors, immersive experience, interactivity, bots, wearable computing, gamification, AI, feedback systems, process-oriented artwork, or data-driven artworks in any media--then this may be the class for you. Students will learn to use basic software and hardware for the manipulation of sound, image,s, and videos that were designed by artists for artists, like: pf5.js, sonic pi, makey-make, arduino, and others.
Only offered in Fall semesters
