 # Robot Controllers Part 1: PID (with Dr. Christian Hubicki)
 
In this live stream, ​@Christian Hubicki and I are teaming up to build a PID Controller, first in python and then in p5.js!

Dr. Christian Hubicki is an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Florida State University and the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.  As Director of the Optimal Robotics Laboratory, his research specializes in bipedal locomotion, specifically optimization methods that apply to both legged robotics and biomechanics.
